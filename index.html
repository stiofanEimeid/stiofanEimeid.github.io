			<h2>A Title</h2>
			<p>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Bender, 
			you risked your life to save me! Say it in Russian! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, 
			and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>

			<h2>A Title</h2>
			<p>You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. 
			All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suitâ€¦ that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>

		<div id="charlie" class="tabcontent">
			<h2>A Title</h2>
			<p>I don't want to be rescued. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Pansy. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, 
			unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</p>
		</div>
		<div id="delta" class="tabcontent">
			<h2>A Title</h2>
			<p>Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Daylight and everything. I just want to talk. 
			It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. 
			Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>
