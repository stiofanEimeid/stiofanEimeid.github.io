			<h2><span class="blue">Founders and Coders</span></h2>
			<h3>Why Founders and Coders?</h3>
			<p>I first learned about Founders and Coders this past October in a Medium article by Moses Skoda about how he became a software developer in ten months. I had just finished my dissertation for my LLM and was looking to develop a new skill. I had been learning the basics of python. Founders and Coders seemed like an excellent path to becoming a software developer. </p>
			<p>Founders and Coders presents a unique opportunity to begin a career in software development through collaborative learning and working with people who share my values. Already, completing the course prerequisites has provided a direction to my learning and shown me what I’m capable of. I’m eager to see how much more I can accomplish as a member of the programme.</p>
                        <p> I also appreciate how Founders and Coders works with organisations such as charities and nonprofits. Ultimately, I want to learn how to make a positive contribution to society and provide the necessary support to those organisations who seek to do likewise.</p>
			<h4>Why Me?</h4>
			<p> I’m new to software development but I’ve had a lifetime of practice as a creative problem-solver.  I took to drawing very early in life. It just came to me naturally. However, sharing something I created with others and knowing they got some enjoyment out of it was always extremely satisfying. </p>
                        <p>I’ve been referred to as a vivacious reader and I’m not in any position to disagree. I enjoy tackling problems, puzzles and riddles. One may overcome most obstacles with a reliable source of knowledge, of which books are a spring. 
                        The most difficult problem I’ve ever encountered is what to do with the rest of my life. What will my career be? Art seemed like the obvious choice; the opportunity to further develop a skill I had spent most of my life cultivating seemed foolish to ignore. However, my experience of pursing art as a career was not what I expected. Something was missing. My life has been relatively privileged so I believe strongly in giving back to those who haven’t as fortunate as me. And although art is an essential part of understanding the human condition, it wasn’t how I wanted to contribute to society. Instead, I wanted to help on a more fundamental level, to address people’s basic needs, to see their rights vindicated. For that, I turned to law, specifically UCD’s Law with Social Justice Degree. </p>
                        <p>Law provided some of the intellectual stimulation I realised I had been missing from art, which relies on a different kind of intelligence.  My insatiable appetite for reading was put to good use. It challenged my preconceptions about the law, and helped me understand where real change comes from. While the law is important and makes a difference in peoples’ lives, progress does not come from the courtroom but the streets. The real power lies in people and social movements. </p>
                        <p>However, four years of law didn’t seem enough to prepare me to be a human rights advocate. I took the initiative and decided to complete an LLM in human rights in the University of Nottingham. The LLM gave me more responsibility for my education and was particularly conducive to my personal development. I challenged myself and achieved things I wasn’t sure I was capable of. I competed in a prestigious mooting competition, joined Scholars at Risk, a student-led initiative that advocates for the protection of the rights of scholars, wrote a 45-page dissertation, and felt more comfortable speaking out against the injustice I saw in society. Through these challenges I gained greater certainty of who I was and what were my values. I saw it wasn’t my place to try and save people, but to help people help themselves. Law with its byzantine procedures and processes appeared to be an impediment to fairness and equality. It wasn’t driven by logic but by experience, and values that didn’t always constitute what I considered fairness and equality.</p>
                        <p> Instead, I wanted to use my skills to help the people fighting for change as part of social movements, across the world. There will always be those who follow their hearts and fight for a better world. But they need the proper tools to do so. Software development allowed me to apply the creative part of me somewhat neglected in law and the problem-solving approach that was somewhat neglected in art in a way that made a positive contribution to society. I was never lost searching for a career. I just took the long way round. And I’m not entirely sure it could have been any other way. </p>
                        <p>I’m not afraid of starting a new career if it means finding the one that is best for me. That’s the big problem I’m trying to solve, and software development and Founders and Coders may just be the way to do that. The opportunity to apply all my skills, creative and logical, to a career that allows me to empower other people is certainly worth a shot. Thanks for reading.
